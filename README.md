![Alt Text](https://github.com/Miral086/Handwritten-Alphabet-Recognition/blob/main/web.gif)

The **Alphabet Recognition** project is an interactive application that allows users to engage in two main activities:

1. **Alphabet Quiz:**
   In this mode, users are presented with a randomly chosen alphabet. The user is then prompted to draw the given alphabet using the provided drawing canvas. The system will recognize the drawn alphabet and provide instant feedback on its correctness. Users can challenge themselves to improve their handwriting and alphabet recognition skills.

2. **Alphabet Addition:**
   The second option allows users to contribute to the alphabet recognition system by adding new handwritten alphabets. Users can draw an alphabet on the canvas, label it with its corresponding name, and submit it. These contributed samples can be used to improve the system's accuracy through retraining.

## Features

- Alphabet Quiz: Practice recognizing and drawing alphabets.
- Alphabet Addition: Contribute new handwritten alphabets to improve the recognition system.
- Real-time Feedback: Receive instant feedback on the accuracy of the drawn alphabets.
- User-Friendly Interface: The application offers an intuitive and easy-to-navigate GUI for a seamless user experience.
- Training Mode: The system can be retrained with new data to continuously improve its accuracy.
